# Make Chat

## What we're building

If you've been attending Skyzone for any amount of time now, you should be very acquainted with the chat program Slack.

This live messaging app, along with its little brother Discord, rely heavily on realtime communication.

In this tutorial we're going to be building our very own live messaging application.

## Why is this important?

Clients and servers pass information back and forth constantly, and are a huge part of any communication for a web app. Sockets are how the clients and servers talk to each other, so it's important to know how the bidirectional communication process works in order to build out any web app that utilizes a server.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to...

- Understand how WebSockets work within a server/client relationship through socket.io
- Pass information back and forth from the client and server using the power of bidirectional communication in sockets
- Use sockets to update information on the server
- Use sockets to update information on the client
- Understand how jQuery can help send info through sockets
