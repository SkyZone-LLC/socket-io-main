# Make Chat
## Saving and Destroying Users
â€‹
### Be a Hero and Save These Users!
â€‹
Let's start with updating our` app.js `to save the object `onlineUsers`.
â€‹
Update the `socket.io` code in `app.js` to the following:
â€‹
```js
const io = require('socket.io')(server);
//We'll store our online users here
let onlineUsers = {};
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  // Make sure to send the users to our chat file
  require('./sockets/chat.js')(io, socket, onlineUsers);
})
```
â€‹
Why are we using an object instead of an array to save our users?
â€‹
Great question! This object will actually act as a dictionary to access each user's ID by their username.
â€‹
ID? What ID are you talking about?
â€‹
A socket ID of course! Each socket has a unique ID that identifies it as a unique connected user. So we can make this ID do double duty to identify our users. This is going be helpful for when we implement private messages.
â€‹
In the meantime, let's update `chat.js` to save those `onlineUsers`.
â€‹
Update `/sockets/chat.js` to the following code to save the `onlineUsers`:
â€‹
```js
//chat.js
module.exports = (io, socket, onlineUsers) => {
â€‹
  socket.on('new user', (username) => {
    //Save the username as key to access the user's socket id
    onlineUsers[username] = socket.id;
    //Save the username to socket as well. This is important for later.
    socket["username"] = username;
    console.log(`âœ‹ ${username} has joined the chat! âœ‹`);
    io.emit("new user", username);
  })
â€‹
  socket.on('new message', (data) => {
    console.log(`ðŸŽ¤ ${data.sender}: ${data.message} ðŸŽ¤`)
    io.emit('new message', data);
  })
â€‹
}
```
â€‹
Back to your client, let's ask to see all the online users when the page loads.
â€‹
Add the `socket.emit` line right below `let currentUser` in `/public/index.js`:
â€‹
```js
//index.js
const socket = io.connect();
let currentUser;
// Get the online users from the server
socket.emit('get online users');
```
â€‹
Now update `/sockets/chat.js` to include code to send the online users when someone connects.
â€‹
```js
...
â€‹
socket.on('get online users', () => {
  //Send over the onlineUsers
  socket.emit('get online users', onlineUsers);
})
```
Finally go back to your client, to show the users on the page.
â€‹
Update `/public/index.js` to include a `get online users` socket listener:
â€‹
```js
...
â€‹
socket.on('get online users', (onlineUsers) => {
  //You may have not have seen this for loop before. It's syntax is for(key in obj)
  //Our usernames are keys in the object of onlineUsers.
  for(username in onlineUsers){
    $('.users-online').append(`<div class="user-online">${username}</div>`);
  }
})
```
â€‹
Go ahead and test this out in multiple tabs and see that all users save, regardless of reload.
â€‹
The only problem is that users are not leaving when you close a window. The fix is pretty straightforward, we'll use the built in `socket.on('disconnect')` event to emit that someone left.
â€‹
## Be a Villain and Destroy These Users!
â€‹
When a user closes out of the browser window, we want to get rid of them from our `onlineUsers`.
â€‹
Update `/sockets/chat.js` to include a `disconnect` listener:
â€‹
Hints:
  - there is a [delete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete) function...
  - There's also a [disconnect](https://socket.io/docs/v3/client-api/index.html) listener...
â€‹
```js
...
â€‹
// This fires when a user closes out of the application
// socket.on("disconnect") is a special listener that fires when a user exits out of the application.
socket.on('disconnect', () => {
  //This deletes the user by using the username we saved to the socket
  delete onlineUsers[socket.username]
  io.emit('user has left', onlineUsers);
});
```
â€‹
Now update the client to refresh its online users when a "user has left".
â€‹
Update `/public/index.js` to include a `user has left` listener:
â€‹
```js
...
â€‹
//Refresh the online user list
socket.on('user has left', (onlineUsers) => {
  $('.users-online').empty();
  for(username in onlineUsers){
    $('.users-online').append(`<p>${username}</p>`);
  }
});
```
â€‹
## TEST test
â€‹
Open up multiple browser windows and test joining and leaving the chat.
â€‹
## commit
â€‹
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Users can join and leave chats'
$ git push
```
